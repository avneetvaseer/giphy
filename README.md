In this project i used the Giphy API to build a React.js app.  I fetched  data from an api and  return a listing of the first page of trending gifs. There is a public API that you can consume to list and search through GIFS .(https://developers.giphy.com/). 
I got api key from https://developers.giphy.com/) which i called in axios parameters. 
i used 3 libraries bootstrap , font awesome and axios. 
Made App.jsx to show app logic which then imported index.js
made api call from giphy developers , giphy url trending and several parameter to render out on screen.
